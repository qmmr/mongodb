Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you will need to unwind the To list for each message. 

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of (sender, recipient) pairs.
